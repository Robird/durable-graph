/// Overrides apply to one call only, including CreateBranch; later calls do not inherit them.
/// A lower threshold favors shorter reconstruction chains; a higher one favors fewer Base writes.
/// Under a stable small-Delta model, thresholds 3, 5 and 11 correspond to average reconstruction
/// payloads of 2, 3 and 6 times Base, and write payloads of 1.5, 1.25 and 1.1 times continuous Delta.
/// These are steady-state approximations without budget delays, not bounds on I/O or elapsed time.
/// </remarks>

/// At least 1. Optional Base motivation starts when prospective reconstruction payload strictly
/// exceeds this multiple of current Base payload; it is not a hard read-amplification limit.

/// <param name="BaseBudgetPercent">
/// 1 through 100. Soft optional Base budget relative to the complete post-live Base payload.
/// Required Base writes do not consume it; it does not cap total or physical write bytes.
