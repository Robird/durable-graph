# List package consumer

Run `./experiments/PackageConsumerProbe/Run-ListProbe.ps1` from the repository root.
The optional `-PackageSource <feed> -Version <version>` pair reuses an already packed dependency feed.

This DB-047 witness builds two application versions against real Runtime and StateStore packages,
without project references or manual generator/build wiring. V1 saves a shared `List<LegacyPoint>`,
`List<List<int>>`, arrays of lists, lists of multidimensional arrays of generic structs,
`Box<List<int>>` with both `T` and `List<T>` members, inline structs containing lists, and a World/list cycle.
Consecutive commits cover element replacement, append, middle insert/remove and tail removal while
retaining the same list identity. Increasing Capacity writes no object changes. All intermediate
revisions decode their respective frozen contents; a separate low-level preparation witness clears
the domain list after preparing both Base and Delta and then appends and restores the prepared data.

V2 deletes the LegacyPoint CLR declaration and supplies CurrentPoint with the same Schema ID at V2.
Retained history generates the old exact state DTO and reader. An explicit list element rule set
upgrades each element once for the shared list, receives its List layout/count owner facts, and
forces only that list to Base. An unchanged commit writes no objects; a subsequent element edit
uses Delta on the same domain instances. Cold reopening does not repeat Upgrade, and the original
revision still decodes `FrozenListState<Point.V1>` independently of the removed domain declaration.

Every object's Base v4 representation ID resolves through the persisted SchemaCatalog. Reopening
and reverse-order registration preserve IDs without metadata writes. The upgraded list receives
a new representation ID while its referring World's ID stays stable; subsequent Delta inherits it.

Required stage markers are:

- V1: `ListSeed`, `CompositionsAndCycles`, `ResizeAndCapacity`, `FrozenDelta`, `RepresentationIds`, `ReorderedRegistration`.
- V2: `ListUpgrade`, `SharedOwnerOnce`, `ForcedBaseThenDelta`, `HistoricalExact`, `DeletedDomainStruct`, `ColdReopen`, `IndependentRepresentationUpgrade`, `DeltaInheritsRepresentation`.

Each marker is followed by `True`. The runner publishes and verifies canonical history v5, checks
counts `4 -> 5`, and preserves all accepted file names and hashes. Feed/cache/history/databases
remain in a unique ignored `obj` run directory. The lane verifies package delivery and cross-process
history continuity; malformed bodies, empty-list Upgrade preflight and failure injection belong to
product tests. It makes no compact-insertion or performance claim for the initial positional Delta.
