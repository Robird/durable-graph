# Temporal scalar package consumer

Run from the repository root:

```powershell
./experiments/PackageConsumerProbe/Run-TemporalScalarProbe.ps1
```

Or reuse an nine-package feed built from the same sources:

```powershell
./experiments/PackageConsumerProbe/Run-TemporalScalarProbe.ps1 -PackageSource <feed> -Version <version>
```

The runner packs an isolated dependency closure and uses an isolated package cache. The consumer
has only ordinary Runtime and StateStore PackageReferences; it has no ProjectReference, manual
Analyzer, Import or AdditionalFiles wiring. Artifacts stay in the unique ignored `obj` directory.

V1 saves DateOnly, TimeOnly and DateTimeOffset in direct fields, record struct state, generic
Box values, Nullable arrays, Lists and all three standard Dictionary key/value shapes. It checks
leap-day dates, midnight and final-day ticks, timestamp extrema, shared List identity and cold
NoChange. A change of offset at the same instant produces real owner/inline/List/Nullable List
Deltas; explicitly removing and adding the Dictionary key produces Remove+Add with the new
offset. Domain timestamp lookup still follows the standard same-instant comparison.

V2 deletes the old inline CLR declaration while retaining its exact generated state history.
The same nominal Point family changes its Count field from int to long with an explicit +1000
business conversion. An explicit owner dependency and shared List element upgrade invoke that
conversion once per value. Only the World and shared List rewrite Base; the next save is unchanged,
and later offset edits resume ordinary Delta. Cold reopen retains the exact offsets without
repeating upgrades. Historical exact reads preserve old values and do not call business code.

Required outputs:

```text
TemporalScalarSeed:True:ThreeScalarCompositions:True:ExactOffset:True:OffsetKeyRemoveAdd:True:ColdReopen:True
TemporalScalarUpgrade:True:DeletedInlineClr:True:ExplicitOwnerAndValueUpgrade:True:HistoricalExact:True:ForcedBaseThenDelta:True:ColdReopen:True
```

History counts are `3 -> 5`. New files use v9; accepted filenames, SHA256 hashes and complete
bytes are checked before and after Publish/Verify. This two-generation lane does not replace the
fixed-v8/new-v9 history compatibility tests. No container nominal type changes or implicit time
conversions are exercised; DateTime and local timezone/DST normalization remain outside scope.

The contract and acceptance record live in
[DB-058](../../../docs/design-branches/0058-temporal-scalar-value-slice.md).
